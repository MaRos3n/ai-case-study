## Recommendations


**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
* Use AI to help collect and interpret data points to branch out into growing a more diverse selection of produce. With more information on what the needs of the plants are, AeroFarms could move beyond just greens into a more complicated food to produce (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, etc.).


**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
* Leafy greens can be found easily and cheaply in most areas of the United States. If they want to get ahead of their competitors, then offering a wider variety of produce would help them stand apart. Not only that, but by using AI and machine learning to better monitor plant health and nutritional needs, they could potentially offer some produce that would otherwise cost more to import from farms globally (pineapples, mangos, bananas, etc.).
